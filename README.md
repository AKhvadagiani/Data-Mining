# Data-Mining

The project is prompting the dissemination of free knowledge and supporting collaborative platforms like Wikipedia. Task is optimizing the administrator election process on Wikipedia. Administrators play a vital role in maintaining the integrity and quality of Wikipedia, and it is essential to identify users who are likely to become successful administrators efficiently. 

In this context, the project aims to analyze the voting patterns and network structure of Wikipedia's administrator elections. By leveraging graph analysis and edge prediction techniques, the goal is to predict potential future successful adminship candidates and streamline the election process. This will help Wikipedia ensure that qualified users are identified and promoted more efficiently, thereby enhancing the platform's maintenance and user experience.

The experiment begins with data collection and preparation, utilizing the latest complete dump of Wikipedia page edit history from January 3, 2008. The data is structured into a graph where nodes represent Wikipedia users and directed edges represent votes. Key graph metrics such as clustering coefficient, number of triangles, diameter, and effective diameter are calculated. The distribution of nodes and edges in the largest weakly connected component (WCC) and strongly connected component (SCC) is analyzed to identify patterns and characteristics of successful vs. unsuccessful administrator elections. The role of existing administrators in the voting process is also examined.

Next, feature engineering is conducted to create features based on user activity, voting patterns, and graph metrics. These features include the number of votes received, voting history, and the user's centrality in the network. The data is then split into training and validation sets, and edge prediction models are trained using techniques like logistic regression, random forests, SVM. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Once the models are trained, they are applied to predict potential successful candidates for future administrator elections. A list of top candidates is generated based on prediction scores, and the prediction system is integrated with Wikipedia's adminship request process. Feedback from the Wikipedia community is collected to refine and improve the model.

**The expected value of this project includes streamlining the administrator election process by identifying promising candidates early, thereby reducing the time and effort required for community discussions and votes. It ensures that qualified and capable users are promoted to administrators, enhancing Wikipedia's maintenance and user experience. Additionally, the project builds trust within the Wikipedia community by making the adminship process more transparent and data-driven, encouraging more users to participate, knowing that it is fair and efficient.**

By utilizing graph analysis and edge prediction, ABC aims to enhance Wikipedia's administrator election process. This project supports the efficiency and quality of Wikipedia's administration and fosters a more robust and trustworthy community, aligning with ABC's mission of promoting free knowledge and collaboration.
